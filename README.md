> A pixel-art house where your OpenClaw AI lives -- watch it code, think, rest, and celebrate in real time.

**Watch Claw** is a real-time pixel-art visualization of the [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) AI agent's working state. A lobster-hat character -- representing the OpenClaw agent -- lives in a cozy three-floor house, moving between nine rooms, performing activities, and expressing emotions based on the agent's actual runtime events.

## Quick Start

### Download Desktop App (Recommended)

Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/luyao618/watch-claw-working/releases) page and download the latest version:

- **macOS**: `.dmg` installer or `.zip` archive

The app auto-starts the built-in Bridge Server and connects to your running OpenClaw session. No Node.js or dev tools required.

The desktop app supports:
- **System tray** -- keeps running in the background after closing the window; restore anytime from the tray
- **Always-on-top** -- pin the window so you can watch the character while you code
- **Auto-reconnect** -- reconnects automatically after disconnection; seamlessly follows session switches

### Run from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/luyao618/watch-claw-working.git
cd watch-claw-working
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser, then start an OpenClaw session in another terminal to see the character react.

## How It Works

```
OpenClaw runs a tool  -->  Session log (JSONL)  -->  Bridge Server pushes  -->  Character reacts
```

A lightweight Bridge Server monitors OpenClaw's session logs (`~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/`), detects new entries via `fs.watch`, and pushes them to the browser over WebSocket. The front-end parses these events and translates them into character behaviors.

## Room Mapping

The character moves between rooms based on what the OpenClaw agent is doing:

| What the AI is doing | Where the character goes | Emotion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `web_search` / `web_fetch` | 🌙 Balcony | Curious |
| `read` / `write` / `edit` / `grep` and other file ops | 📚 Study | Focused |
| Download/install (`curl`, `pip install`, `npm install`...) | 📦 Warehouse | Curious |
| Dev/build (`git`, `python`, `node`, `cargo`, `docker`...) | 🖥 Server Room | Focused |
| Generic commands (`ls`, `echo`, etc.) | 🔧 Toolbox | Serious |
| Text reply / thinking | 🛋 Office | Thinking |
| Subagents / multi-session | 🏚 Basement | Thinking |
| Delete files (`rm`, `trash`...) | 🗑 Trash | Serious |
| Idle > 30s / session end | 🛏 Bedroom | Sleepy |

## Keyboard Controls
